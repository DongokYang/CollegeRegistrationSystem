# BITCollegeRegistrationSystem

This repository contains a series of projects developed during the Programming 3 course, focused on building a robust college registration system using ASP.NET MVC. The projects demonstrate CRUD operations, advanced design patterns, and the use of WCF Web Services to manage student registrations, GPA calculations, and other student-related data dynamically.

## Projects Overview

Each project within this series adds functional layers to the college registration system, progressively enhancing its capabilities:

### Assignment 1: MVC Models

- **Focus:** Developing the foundational models using Entity Framework for managing students, courses, and registrations.
- **Features:** Data annotations for validation, and configurations for relationships between entities.

### Assignment 2: MVC Controllers and Views

- **Focus:** Building controllers and views to handle data interaction and user interface for student and course management.
- **Features:** Complete CRUD operations for all entities, with dynamic data presentation using MVC views.

### Assignment 3: Design Patterns

- **Focus:** Integration of Singleton and State design patterns to manage unique states like GPA statuses and singleton instances for application settings.
- **Features:** Use of design patterns to maintain GPA state transitions and manage singleton configurations effectively.

### Assignment 4: Data Migrations and Stored Procedures

- **Focus:** Utilizing data migrations for database management and stored procedures for complex data queries.
- **Features:** Implementation of migrations to handle schema changes and stored procedures to optimize data transactions.

### Assignment 5: WCF Web Services

- **Focus:** Development and integration of WCF Services to handle complex operations like registration processing and GPA updates externally.
- **Features:** Decoupling of business logic through WCF Services, enhancing the system's scalability and maintenance.

### Assignment 6: Advanced LINQ and Data Binding

- **Focus:** Employing LINQ extensively for data manipulation and binding data to Windows Forms controls for desktop applications.
- **Features:** Advanced data queries and real-time data binding to provide responsive user experiences on desktop clients.

### Assignment 7: Batch Processing and File I/O

- **Focus:** Implementing batch processing for handling bulk data operations and file I/O for data interchange.
- **Features:** Automated batch jobs for updating student records and handling data imports/exports through XML and text files.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET MVC**: For creating the web application.
- **Entity Framework**: For ORM-based data manipulation.
- **SQL Server**: For database storage.
- **WCF (Windows Communication Foundation)**: For creating and consuming web services.
- **C#**: Main programming language.
- **LINQ**: For efficient data queries.
- **Visual Studio**: As the development environment.
